 DIP_AUS_balkans_1:0 "Demand Belgrade"
 DIP_AUS_balkans_1_desc:0 "The Serbian state to our south is a threat to us, but not as much as we are to them. We can resolve this tension by sending them an ultimatum demanding the partition of their country."

 DIP_AUS_balkans_2_desc:0 "Serbia is helpless before us. We are free to annex them at leisure."

 DIP_AUS_balkans_4:0 "Fate of Romania"
 DIP_AUS_balkans_4_desc:0 "Romania is helpless before us. We are free to annex them at leisure."
 DIP_AUS_fortify_deep:0 "Defence in Depth"
 DIP_AUS_fortify_deep_desc:0 "Austria's borders are long, and it may not always be possible to defend all of them. Instead, we should ensure that our most important cities are well-fortified in the event the enemy breaks through our lines."
 DIP_AUS_fortify_GER_1:0 "Sudetenland Fortifications"
 DIP_AUS_fortify_GER_1_desc:0 "The Sudetenland in Bohemia is our first line of defence against Germany. We must ensure that it is well fortified."

 DIP_AUS_fortify_GER_3:0 "Fortify North Tyrol"
 DIP_AUS_fortify_GER_3_desc:0 "Though losing Tyrol wouldn't be a total disaster, it is easy to defend so we should fortify it to make it as hard to take as possible."
 DIP_AUS_fortify_GER_4:0 "Fortify Czech Silesia"
 DIP_AUS_fortify_GER_4_desc:0 "A cunning German general might attempt to outflank our Sudeten fortifications not to the west, but to the east. This avenue must also be fortified."
 DIP_AUS_fortify_ITA_1:0 "Fortify Trieste"
 DIP_AUS_fortify_ITA_1_desc:0 "Our Italian border is mercifully mountainous and difficult to attack across. The one potential weak spot is Trieste, on the Adriatic coast: if we build up our fortifications here it will be almost impossible for the Italians to get through."
 DIP_AUS_fortify_ITA_2:0 "Fortify South Tyrol"
 DIP_AUS_fortify_ITA_2_desc:0 "Italian mountain infantry is not to be underestimated. Let us fortify South Tyrol, just in case they try to attack us across the Alps."

 DIP_ENG_africa_1_desc:0 "Now that Gibraltar has been restored to its rightful British rulers, we should establish a base on the opposite side of the Pillars of Hercules so that we exert total control over the western entrance to the Mediterranean. The Moroccans there may not be too happy, but really, what are they going to do about it?"
 DIP_ENG_benelux_1:0 "Demand Holland"
 DIP_ENG_benelux_1_desc:0 "The UK has not had a foothold in the Low Countries since Calais was lost in 1558. Our current strategic situation would be greatly aided by gaining a new one, and the Netherlands look too weak to resist us..."
 DIP_ENG_iberia_1:0 "Renew the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance"
 DIP_ENG_iberia_1_desc:0 "The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, ratified at the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, is the oldest alliance in the world still in force. In these turbulent times we should remind Portugal of our historical friendship - we may need their aid."

 DIP_ENG_iberia_3:0 "Independence for Galicia"
 DIP_ENG_iberia_3_desc:0 "Galicia has always been slightly different from the rest of Spain. We should create an independent Galicia under British protection to give ourselves more of a foothold in the peninsula."

 DIP_FRA_benelux_1_desc:0 "Belgium has always been an unnatural creation, half French-speaking and half Flemish-speaking. We should solve this problem by proposing a referendum in French-speaking Wallonia to join France."
 DIP_FRA_fortify_ENG_1:0 "Atlantic Wall - Northern Section"
 DIP_FRA_fortify_ENG_1_desc:0 "We should fortify our Atlantic coast against a possible invasion from Britain. The most obvious place to invade would be the northern coast, so we'll start there."

 DIP_FRA_iberia_1:0 "Demand Navarre"
 DIP_FRA_iberia_1_desc:0 "The Crown of Navarre passed to French control in 1589 when King Henry III of Navarre became King Henry IV of France. Ever since then Spain has unlawfully occupied the southern half of the former Kingdom. We should demand it back."
 DIP_FRA_iberia_2:0 "Protect Catalonia"
 DIP_FRA_iberia_2_desc:0 "The Catalan minority have long suffered under Spanish rule. Perhaps they would be better off under French... 'protection'."
 DIP_FRA_iberia_3:0 "Fate of Spain"
 DIP_FRA_iberia_3_desc:0 "Spain has proven that it is incapable of defending its own sovereignty. Let us end this joke of a country for once and for all."
 DIP_GER_benelux_1:0 "Demand Friesland"
 DIP_GER_benelux_1_desc:0 "The people of Friesland have always been very closely tied to Germany. We should demand the area from the Netherlands."
 DIP_GER_scandinavia_1:0 "Demand Jutland"
 DIP_GER_scandinavia_1_desc:0 "Danes are just Germans with funny accents, and the presence of an independent Denmark on the European mainland is an affront to both German nationhood and security."
 DIP_GER_fortify_AUS_1:0 "Fortify Saxony"
 DIP_GER_fortify_AUS_1_desc:0 "The Austrian territory of Bohemia is alarmingly close to our capital, Berlin. We must build defences in Saxony to protect the city as a matter of urgency."

 DIP_GER_fortify_FRA_desc:0 "The Imperial Territory of Elsaß-Lothringen was the final addition to the core lands of the German Empire, but France was not too happy we took it off them. We should fortify it to prevent them retaking it."
 DIP_GER_fortify_SOV_1:0 "Fortify East Prussia"
 DIP_GER_fortify_SOV_1_desc:0 "If an attack comes from Russia, it will hit East Prussia and the historic city of Königsberg first. We should build defences to stop our Prussian lands falling."
 DIP_GER_fortify_SOV_2:0 "Fortify West Prussia"
 DIP_GER_fortify_SOV_2_desc:0 "Our East Prussian fortifications will not be enough if Russia launches a full-scale assault. We must extend the fortifications along the rest of our border to be truly secure."
 DIP_ITA_africa_1:0 "Colonise Tunisia"
 DIP_ITA_africa_1_desc:0 "Italy is the heir to Rome, and as such is the natural ruler over all the Mediterranean. We should spread our empire across the sea to Tunisia."
 DIP_ITA_africa_2:0 "Quarta Sponda"
 DIP_ITA_africa_2_desc:0 "After Tunisia, our next logical conquest is the 'Quarta Sponda', or 'Fourth Coast' of Italy, namely Libya. Unfortunately they are a bit bigger than Tunisia and might put up some resistance. No matter, we shall conquer them easily."
 DIP_ITA_fortify_AUS:0 "Fortify Lombardy & Veneto"
 DIP_ITA_fortify_AUS_desc:0 "Lombardy and Veneto were only recently won back from Austria. We should fortify them to prevent any attempts to resubjugate the people there."

 DIP_SOV_fortify_deep:0 "Defence in Depth"
 DIP_SOV_fortify_deep_desc:0 "Russia's borders are far too vast to be able to reliably defend them all. We should fortify some strategic cities to hold out in case the enemy breaks through."
 DIP_SOV_fortify_TUR:0 "Fortify the Caucasus"
 DIP_SOV_fortify_TUR_desc:0 "To the west of our Caucasian lands is our old enemy, Turkey. We should build forts in Georgia and Armenia to defend against a possible attack."
 DIP_SOV_scandinavia_1:0 "Demand Lappland"

 DIP_TUR_africa_1_desc:0 "The upstart Egyptians consider themselves an independent nation, when really they are merely a province of the Ottoman Empire. We should make them recognise this fact."
 DIP_TUR_africa_2:0 "Subjugate Libya"
 DIP_TUR_africa_2_desc:0 "Like Egypt, the Libyans also entertain ideas of sovereignty. And like Egypt, they are merely a rebellious province which must be brought to their senses."
 DIP_TUR_balkans_1:0 "Demand Thrace"
 DIP_TUR_balkans_1_desc:0 "Bulgaria has no historical justification for owning Thrace, whereas it was once Ottoman land. We should demand it off them, as a stepping-stone towards Greece."
 DIP_TUR_balkans_2:0 "Alliance with Bulgaria"
